## OO Language Comparison

* Pick two object-oriented languages.
* Form a team to work on the comparison.
  * You can be a team of 1.
  * Teams greater than 4 are usually not a good idea.
* Using the comparison criteria provided, compare the two languages
through documentation and code examples.
* The documentation is to be written in markdown.
* The documentation and code examples are to be in a
GitHub public repository that the team uses.
* The **home page** is to be the README.md for the repository.
* Other mark down pages can be linked using relative links in markdown files.
  * [Relative links in markdown files](https://github.com/blog/1395-relative-links-in-markup-files).
  * Here is an example of a relative link to another md: [second.md](second.md)
* The README.md is to include near the top:
    * The two languages being compared.
    * The names of the members of the team.
* The URL for the GitHub repository for your team is to be submitted via an assignment on Canvas.

### Comparison Criteria

* Language purpose/genesis
  * Why was the language created?
  * What problems was the language trying to address?
  * Is the language a reaction to a previous language or a replacement for another language?
* Unique features of the language
  * Does the language have any particularly unique features?
* Name spaces
  * How are name spaces implemented?
  * How are name spaces used?
* Types
    * What types does the language support?
    * Are both reference and value types supported?
    * Can new value types be created?
* Classes
  * Defining
  * Creating new instances
  * Constructing/initializing
  * Destructing/de-initializing
* Instance reference name in data type (class)
  * this?  self?
* Properties
  * Getters and setters...write your own or built in?
  * Backing variables?
  * Computed properties?
* Interfaces / protocols
  * What does the language support?
  * What abilities does it have?
  * How is it used?
* Inheritance / extension
* Reflection
  * What reflection abilities are supported?
  * How is reflection used?
* Memory management

  * Garbage collection?
  * Automatic reference counting?
* Comparisons of references and values
  * How are values compared? (i.e. comparing two strings)
* Null/nil references
  * Which does the language use? (null/nil/etc)
  * Does the language have features for handling null/nil references?
* Errors and exception handling
* Lambda expressions, closures, or functions as types
* Implementation of listeners and event handlers
* Singleton
  * How is a singleton implemented?
  * Can it be made thread-safe?
  * Can the singleton instance be lazily instantiated?
* Procedural programming
  * Does the language support procedural programming?
