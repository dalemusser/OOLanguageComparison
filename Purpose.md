# Java
#### James Gosling is credited with creating java in June 1991. Originally it was aimed at the digital cable television industry but it shifted to the internet. At this time the first web browsers were being released and java was perfect for embedding new technology into the browser. Gosling wanted to use a syntax that would be familiar to C/C++ users but didn't want the other low level features. There were 5 primary goals that java set out to tackle
  1. It must be "simple, object-oriented, and familiar".
  2. It must be "robust and secure".
  3. It must be "architecture-neutral and portable".
  4. It must execute with "high performance".
  5. It must be "interpreted, threaded, and dynamic".
#### Java 1.0 was released in January 1996 for Solaris, Windows, Mac OS Classic, and Linux. It came with the virtual machine, class libraries, and development tools like the java compiler
